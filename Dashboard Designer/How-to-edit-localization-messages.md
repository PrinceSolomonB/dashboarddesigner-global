# Editing the localization messages

Localized message files can be edited and changed for any specific texts.

> Read [How to add new localization](/Dashboard Designer/How-to-add-new-localizations.md) to know how to convert `.resx` file to `.xml` or `.txt` format and upload the file and translate to the desired language before editing it.

3. `Download` your translated `.xml` file and convert it to `.resx` file using any converter or use the [Resource File Generator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ccec7sz1(v=vs.110).aspx) if you are using `.txt` file and replace the original `.resx` file with the downloaded file.

    Close all the instances of the Syncfusion Dashboard Designer and restart to see the updated messages.
