# Localization

`Localization` is the process of adapting an application into the different linguistic and cultural contexts - involving much more than the simple translation of the text.

Syncfusion Dashboard Designer is released with localization support.

The default language is English `en-US`.

Read the below documentation on How to add new localizations and how to edit existing localizations in the Syncfusion Dashboard Designer.
